<h1>About Rosa Parks</h1>

<img src="rosaparks.jpg" alt="Rosa Parks">

<p><b>Rosa Parks</b>, often hailed as the <i>"Mother of the Civil Rights Movement,"</i> made an indelible mark on American history through her quiet act of defiance. On <b>December 1, 1955</b>, in Montgomery, Alabama, Parks, a seamstress and <b>NAACP activist</b>, refused to give up her seat to a white passenger on a segregated bus. Her courageous act was not the first of its kind, but it sparked a pivotal moment in the fight against racial segregation in the United States. Parks' dignified refusal to obey unjust laws ignited the <b>Montgomery Bus Boycott</b>, a pivotal year-long protest led by Martin Luther King Jr. that challenged segregation laws and catapulted the Civil Rights Movement onto the national stage.

Parks worked tirelessly, dedicating her life to fighting against <i>discrimination, inequality, and injustice</i>. Her commitment to the cause of equality continued for decades, advocating for voter registration, education, and fair housing. Parks' unwavering determination and bravery in the face of adversity inspired countless individuals and left an enduring legacy that continues to influence social justice movements worldwide.
